# Tauri: An Ultimate Project Template

This template should help get you started developing with [Tauri](https://tauri.app), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) (w/ [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)) in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

The architecture is based on practices suggested by [@alan2207](https://github.com/alan2207) in his [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md).

In addition, this template configures [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [Lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) for pre-commits.
